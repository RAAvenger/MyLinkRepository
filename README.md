## Documents
- [Generating Sortable GUIDs Using NewId](https://andrewlock.net/generating-sortable-guids-using-newid/) by Andrew Lock: An excellent document about how to use GUIDs in databases as primary keys.
- [NetEscapades.EnumGenerators: A Source Generator for Enum Performance](https://andrewlock.net/netescapades-enumgenerators-a-source-generator-for-enum-performance/) by Andrew Lock: A high-performance library to work with enums.
- [An Introduction to Microservices](https://auth0.com/blog/an-introduction-to-microservices-part-1/): This article helps understand the basic fundamentals of microservice architecture.
- [Clean Architecture with .NET Core: Getting Started](https://jasontaylor.dev/clean-architecture-getting-started/) by Jason Taylor: One of the best-designed templates to write a project based on clean architecture is Jason Taylor's Clean Architecture Solution Template. In this document, he provides an overview of Clean Architecture and explains how to use the template.
- [CQRS Pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs): This document thoroughly explains CQRS. CQRS is a well-known pattern that you’ll probably use (or should use) when designing your backend. According to this document: "CQRS stands for Command and Query Responsibility Segregation, a pattern that separates read and update operations for a data store. Implementing CQRS in your application can maximize its performance, scalability, and security. The flexibility created by migrating to CQRS allows a system to better evolve over time and prevents update commands from causing merge conflicts at the domain level."
 
## Repositories
- [CleanArchitecture](https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture): Jason Taylor's Clean Architecture Solution Template.

## Books
- [Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerate_(book)): One of the best books to read if you want to learn about DevOps. It highlights how you can measure your software delivery performance using the following factors: Change Lead Time, Deployment Frequency, Change Failure Rate, and Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR).
